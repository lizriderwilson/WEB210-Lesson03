            <h2>Freelance Graphic and Web Designer</h2>

            <p>Hi there! I'm a freelance graphic and web designer focused on front-end projects. As an artist and all-around-creative who knows first hand the importance of being able to bring one's ideas to life on the web, I have come to develop a passion for helping fellow creatives establish their online presence. If you are an artist or maker looking to set up a portfolio, blog, or shop, I'd love to help you make your mark!</p>

              <h3>Illumine Craft</h3>
              <p>Illumine Craft is my textile art portfolio and web shop where I showcase my knitting, sewing, embroidery, and other fiber art. The branding is themed heavily around the concept of magic (craft) and textiles (craft) relating to each other as important meditative practices that tie us to our ancestors and give us strength through self-sufficiency. </p>

                <h3>Neko Hanten</h3>
                <p>Neko Hanten is my side project where I moonlight as an indie game developer. This is where my passions for art and coding (and video games, of course) are married into one. I primarily work on small projects that heavily feature my artwork and love for bright colors and fun imagery. I go into depth on the development of my projects on this site, but the games themselves are available for download through my itch.io page.</p>
